#What Is Condition:Black ?

Condition Black  is  the  place  in a  fight  or combat where you cease to  exist. It  is  in this  condition  that all cognitive operations  cease  to  register. There is no thinking, no decision-making, no internal dialogue, no reasoning, no regard for safety and importantly, no fear. There  is  no  before. There  is  no  after. There  is  only  now.  
  
  
  
This  is  the  state  of  existence  described  by the Samurai Warrior as, complete disregard for the self.  
  
  
  
##  What  does  Condition:Black  do?  
  
As cybersecurity attacks and real-world  (physical)  outcomes become intertwined the  consequences  to  life,  liberty, and  free  trade will be  affected  in the blink of an  eye. Most organizations are not ready for a world where systems make decisions in nanoseconds, and analysts are overwhelmed with telemetry and hindered by policy. We believe there is a better way. We also believe that cyber "samurai" are forged through experience and opportunity. We are building the next generation of cyber samurai and developing the tools to fight tomorrows fights.
